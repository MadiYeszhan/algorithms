# Algorithms
Algorithms repository as the name implies contains implementations for various common data structures, algorithms and coding problems asked during the coding interviews. Most of the implementations is referred from various sources online. 
This algorithm collection enables to refer and revise these commonly asked problems during the interviews. It provides various data structure implementations such as LinkedList, Stack, Queue, BinaryTree, Graph etc. Also some of the famous common algorithms such as sorting, string manipulation, array problems and thread programming.
